== PROJECT: BB Productive - Level 3

---

== Overview

My team consisting of 5 software engineering students were tasked to enhance a basic command line interface desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We decided to morph it into a gamified productivity cum task manager application called BBProductive. BBProductive provides CRUD functionalities for tasks and offers a built-in Pomodoro that keeps a user focused on work for fixed intervals. It also provides a virtual pet that grows with more work done by using the Pomodoro or completing tasks.


== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability for the user to track their app usage.
** What it does: The “stats” command allows the user to view the statistics panel. Firstly, it displays the Daily Challenge, which tracks the total duration the user ran the Pomodoro on the current day. Secondly, it contains 2 bar graphs that tracks the number of tasks done and total duration the Pomodoro was run for the past 7 days.
** Justification: The user can keep track of their progress for the day as well as over the past week, and make necessary adjustments to ensure that they maintain their productivity.
** Highlights: This implementation was challenging as the data structure for storing this information had to be well considered. I want to keep track of data only in the past n (7) days while accounting for usage across different days. I defined the CustomQueue data structure that initialises with 7 DayData objects to store information for the past 7 days. It carries information over to a new day by popping the oldest day’s DayData from the head of the queue, and adding the new day’s DayData at the end of the queue.   

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed release `v1.2.1` on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Morphed the basic GUI layout from addressbook to BBProductive by implementing PetDisplay, PomodoroDisplay and StatisticsDisplay. 
*** Set up storage functionality for statistics.json as well as non-trivial helper methods to access and update the file.
*** Wrote additional test cases for existing features.
** Documentation:
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): 
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class 
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates
