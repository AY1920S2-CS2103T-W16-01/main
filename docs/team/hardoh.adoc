== PROJECT: BB Productive - Level 3

---

== About this project

My 5-man strong team of software-engineering students were tasked to take a basic command line interface desktop application called, addressbook, and improve upon it. We came up with Task Manager which offers gamification elements. Apart from standard CRUD capabilities expected of a task manager, BBProductive includes a “Pomodoro” timer to help users do manageable work cycles. BBProductive also has a virtual pet that grows and changes depending on how much work the user has done.

== Summary of contributions

* Enhancements: I implemented the Pomodoro core feature of the app.
** What it does: The “pom” command allows the user to activate the pomodoro feature. It takes a second input from the user, the index of a chosen task  and starts a timer. This timer is set to 25 minutes by default but can be adjusted by the user via settings or for a single instance via the “tm/” prefix. Upon expiration of the timer, the app prompts users to check on their progress and updates the task manager accordingly. The app will also prompt if the user wants to begin the pomodoro-standard break time.
** Justification: The Pomodoro technique is a productivity framework we decided to adopt as it has been championed by various sites and creatives. It was also voted one of the most popular techniques on LifeHacker.
** Highlights: First, the basic command parser provided by AB3 gave me a good foundation to branch from. I had to adapt the parser to accept multiple types of input (i.e. I accept “pom 1” and “pom pause” for example). Second, building the actual pomodoro feature required me to use JavaFX’s Timeline class. The Timeline class adequately served my requirements for the Pomodoro work and rest cycles. Lastly, to handle prompts during pomodoro cycles, I decided to swap the “Command Executor” that exists in the Main Window class so I could better encapsulate Pomodoro related responses.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a switch tabs command that allows the user to navigate to between the tabs.
