== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PomodoroDisplay`, `StatisticsDisplay`, `PetDisplay` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaskListParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user or highlighting the text input field with a certain color.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1, 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1, 2` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task List, Pet, Pomodoro and statistics data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task List data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pet data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pomodoro data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Statistics data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Sorting
==== Implementation
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java[`SortCommand.java`]

.Sequence of executing a sort command
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]
The sort command takes in a list of fields and generates FieldComparators as seen in the diagram and then uses Comparator.thenComparing to aggregate the comparators. The first field provided will be of the highest sort order. The Model will then set the aggregated comparator on the `TaskList`.

.Class diagram of SortedList
image::SortedListClassDiagram.png[]
We use a new SortedList within TaskList because FilteredList does not allow for sorting. As such we have the FilteredList reference the SortedList and the SortedList refernce the UniqueTaskList. By warpping the lists around another, this allows the SortedList and FilteredList to read changes to the UniqueTaskList and perform the appropriate filtering and sorting based on predicate/comaprators set.

.Sequence of initializing the Sorted List
image::SortInitliazeDiagram.png[]

Due to the requirements mentioned, this is how we generate our FilteredList. We set FilteredList to reference the SortedList and then the SortedList to reference the UniqueTaskList.

==== Updating UI
image::SortUiSequenceDiagram.png[]

Meanwhile to update the UI on the newest sorting order, the latest sortOrder is set on the `TaskList`. The LogicManager is then able to access the sort order through the Model and provide the `MainWindow` with the sort order. The MainWindow then sets it on the `TaskListPanel`.

SortCommandResult extends CommandResult and contains an additional String attribute `sortOrder`.

=== AutoComplete
Auto complete is triggered when users press tab while focussed on the command line.

==== Implementation
//TODO maybe shift this up?
.AutoComplete Sequence Diagram
image::ACSequenceDiagram.png[]

When a user presses tab on the command line, a key event handler in the CommandBox calls the suggestCommand function of MainWindow with the user input. The MainWindow then passes the user input through the LogicManager to CommandCompletor. We pass the input through LogicManager so that it can pass TaskList details to the CommandCompletor (such as taskList length). The CommandCompletor then parses the input and returns one of three thigns:
. CompletorResult
. CompletorDeletionException

==== Auto Complete Overview

.Activity diagram of auto complete
image::ACActivityDiagram.png[width=790]
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Auto completion of a word happens when either:

. the input matches the start of a target word
. the edit distance between the input and the target < 2.
=====
[#completion criteria]

The above diagram shows the decisions `CommandCompletor` goes through when deciding how to edit users input.

. attempts to complete the command word against all possible commands based on the criteria in the callout above
.. if command word is unrecognized, throws a `CompletorException`
.. else it performs argument checks and auto completes as necessary

==== Argument checks overview

. If the input is an add/edit/pom command then CommandCompletor will attempt to add prefixes.
.. add/edit command -> add priority and reminder prefixes
.. pom command -> add timer prefix
. If input is a delete/done command
.. remove any invalid indices that are greater than the length of the displayed task list or that are not a positive integer
. If input is a sort command
.. Auto completion of fields is performed based on the criteria mentioned in the callout <<completion criteria, here>>
.. If it cannot be completed and is not recongized, then it is removed

==== Prefix Completion
image::ACPrefixActivityDiagram.png[]

Here we take a closer look at how prefix completion is implemented. We iterate through every word of the user's input and then check if the word is a valid task field. If it, we append the prefix and update the hasPrefix boolean to true so that we don't append duplicate prefixes. The input is updated and we iterate until we reach the end of the input.

==== Index Completion
image::ACIndexActivityDiagram.png[]

Similar to before, we iterate through the arguments and we remove indexes that are either out of the displayed TaskList's size or not a positive integer. We then append it to a removed list so that we can inform the user what input has been removed.

==== Sort field Completion
Is performed simply by iterating through all arguments and performing the checks mentioned above.

// TODO maybe can insert diagram as well?
==== Auto Complete output: 
. If words are completed or prefixes are added or nothing has changed for the input, auto complete is labelled as successful
. If any input is deleted (invalid index or sort field), `CommandCompletor` will raise a warning by throwing a `CompletorDeletionException`
. If no command word is found, auto complete is labelled as an error and `CommandCompletor` will raise a `CompletorException`

==== Auto Complete Success UI

.AutoComplete Success UI 
image::ACSuccess.png[width=600]

* `CommandTextField` is set to green
* `CommandTextField` text is replaced by the suggested command
* Feedback is also provided on what changes have been made
** If input has been removed, `ResultDisplay` is set to orange

==== Auto Complete Failure UI

.AutoComplete Failure UI 
image::ACFailure.png[width=600]

* `CommandTextField` is set to green
* `CommandTextField` text is unchanged
* Feedback is provided that command word is not recognized

=== Enhanced Find
We've built upon the existing find function in AB-3 to filter tasks based on phrases instead of words.

==== Implementation

.Find Command Sequence diagram
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

* After setting the predicate on the model, the FilteredList will apply the Test method of the predicate and only display tasks with a score < 2. Scoring will be discussed below
* Model will also generate a searchComparator based on the output of applying the Predicate on a Task
** This comparator is then used to display more relevant search results to the user
* If the model has existing comparators set via the SortCommand, they are applied for search results of equal relevance

==== Predicate

.Scoring decision
image::PredicateSequenceDiagram.png[]

* We perform the filtering by taking chunks of the task name whereby the number of words in a chunk = number of words used in the search term
* We iterate through all chunks of the task name and calculate a score for each chunk and taking the minimum of those scores as the task's relevance score
** a smaller score means a more relevant task
* The calculation of a chunk is decided by:
** If edit distance between chunk and search term < 2, score is set to 1
** If the search term matches the start of the chunk, score is set to 1
** If the chunk is the same as the search term, score is set to 0

In addition the predicate decrements the score for every tag that matches so that find commands with more matches will be showed first.

==== Other Considerations
* We chose to not use edit distance for search terms of string length less than 3 as this would bring about alot of false positives given that that the edit distance between words of length < 3 will easily be 1
* We also chose to display task names who's start matches the search term for ease of usage

[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
Pomodoro is activated by the `pom` command. It follows the same execution flow as many of the other commands in BBProductive.

.Interactions Inside Logic Component for the pom 1 command
image::PomSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Implementation
Pomosoero's features are implemented mainly in `seedu.address.logic` package. The `PomodoroManager` class is used to maniulate the timer and configure the relevant UI elements. The timer is facilitated by `javafx.animation.Timeline`.

Through the use of the Pomodoro feature, there are occasions where the app has to prompt the user for specific input in order to progress. This behaviour flow is represented in the _Pomodoro Acctivity_ diagram.

.Pomodoro Activity Diagram
image::PomodoroActivityDiagram.png[width=400]

The `PomodoroManager` maintains a  `prompt_state` indicating what the app might be prompting the user at a given time.

*Pomodoro Prompt States*

* `NONE`: There is no particular prompt happening. The default state when the app is in the neutral state. (i.e. No pomodoro running.)
* `CHECK_DONE`: This state occurs when a timer expires during a Pomodoro cycle.
* `CHECK_TAKE_BREAK`: This state occurs after user response has been received in the CHECK_DONE state.
* `CHECK_DONE_MIDPOM`: This state occurs when the user calls done on a task that is the Pomodoro running task.

Pomodoro has settings that can be configured by the user:

* Pomodoro Time: This defines how long the Pomodoro work period is. The default is 25 minutes.
* Break Time: This defines how long the breaks last in between Pomodoro periods. The default is 5 minutes.

This data is captured and stored in the `Pomodoro` class in `seedu.address.model`, which interacts with the app’s storage system. `PomodoroManager` also updates the `Pomodoro` model on what task is being run and the time remaining in a particular cycle. This allows the time progress to be persistent in between app closures and relaunches.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of tasks
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* need motivation to get things done

*Value proposition*: We integrate a Pomodoro-Pet environment into a full fledged task manager. The pet system serves to gamify the act of doing tasks, thereby motivating users, and the Pomodoro helps users get into a regular work/rest cycle. This integrationcovers all aspects of productivity in line platform. It covers motivation, organising of tasks and also how to go about doing them. This all in one solution is seldom found in other applications which implement maybe 1 or 2 of these features.
