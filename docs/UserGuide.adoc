[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
_This section provides a quick description for the common terminologies used in this user guide._

*Task*: A task is something that you need to complete. It is represented as a card on the right side of the window. Set reminders, add tags and more to better manage your tasks!

*Pomodoro*: A productivity technique that consists of doing focused work for 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. This technique prevents you from tiring out while doing work.

*Pet*: The pet you will interact with to manage your tasks and pomodoros. You can also level up the pet by completing more tasks/pomodoros.

[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
_This section describes the Pomodoro feature in detail and contains all commands you can use to take advantage of it_

==== What's Pomodoro?
In the late 1980s, a gentleman named Francesco Cirillo devised a time management method called the Pomodoro Technique. Essentially, a single cycle consists of two parts, 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minutes break. This cycle repeats for as long as you want to get work done.

==== How do you use it?
Trying to prevent burnout? BB productive offers you the option to try out the pomodoro tenchinique! The pomodoro technique breaks down work into manageable intervals spaced out with short breaks so as to not tired you out._

To get started, follow the instructions below:

===== Command: `pom`

First, you can activate the Pomodoro timer with a task in focus. You can also add an optional timer amount field, different from the default time of 25 minutes, for that particular cycle.

Format: `pom <index> [tm/<amount in minutes>]`

You can use the value (decimals allowed) following `tm/` to represent your desired amount of time in minutes for a particular pomodoro cycle.

.Example screen when pom is successfully executed.

===== Command: `pom pause`

You can pause a running Pomodoro timer.

.Example screen when pom is successfully paused
image::pom_pause.png[width=790]

===== Command: `pom continue`

You can resume a paused Pomodoro timer.

.Example screen when pom is successfully resumed

==== What happens when the timer's up?

===== "Done" the task
Once the timer expires, the app will prompt you if you have finished the task. You need only respond with Yes (Y) or No (N) in order to proceed.

.Prompt when the pomodoro timer expires

===== Break-time
Afterwards, the app will prompt you if you would like to begin a 5 minute break (as per the pomodoro technique). Similarly, you need to respond with Yes (Y) or No (N). Responding with No will set the app to its neutral state. Yes will start the break timer.

Note: You will not be able to do execute other commands during these prompts.

===== Back to work
At the end of the break, the app will return to it's "neutral" state and you can  repeat the process, if you wish.

=== Reminders

==== What's a reminder?
BBProductive provides an avenue to remember to do time sensitive tasks in the form of reminders. When the time for the reminder has arrived, BBProductive alerts you to do the task! Never forget to do buy milk or any other time sensitive task ever again!

==== How do you use it?
Add a reminder to your task by adding `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM` when editing or adding a task. A pop up containing the task name and description will then appear reminding you to complete the task at the specified date and time.

==== Command `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`
===== Add Task with reminder 
Add task with reminder with the following command `add n/<name> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more. 

For example: `add n/Buy Milk r/11/11/20@23:59` as shown below.

.Input for adding task with reminder.

Results in a task with the reminder's date in the task card.

.Success for adding task with reminder.

===== Edit Task with reminder 
Edit a task to include a reminder with the following command `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more. 

For example: `edit 1 r/01/11/20@11:59` as shown below.

.Input for editing task to have reminder or edit reminder itself.
image::reminder_edit.png[width=395]

Results in a task with the reminder's date in the task card.

.Success for editing task's reminder.

=== Recurring

==== What's Recurring?
Recurring tasks allows you to have repeated tasks either every day or every week. This means the task previously set as done will be set as unfinished. Furthermore, if there is a reminder set, recurring tasks is smart enough to change the reminder date according to the interval you set. This means a reminder that has already been triggered for a daily recurring task will also fire again the following day.

==== How do you use it?
Add a recurring attribute to your task by adding `rec/d` for daily recurring tasks or `rec/w` for weekly. This will trigger the recurring behaviour for the task including the task's done and reminder attribute.

===== Command `rec/d` or `rec/w`
===== Add Task with recurring 
Add task with recurring with the following command `add n/<name> rec/d` or `add n/<name> rec/w`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more. 

For example: `add n/Buy Milk rec/d` as shown below.

.Input for adding recurring attribute to task.
image::recurring_add.png[width=395]

Results in a task with the recurring attribute in the task card.

.Success for adding recurring attribute to task.
image::recurring_add_success.png[width=790]

===== Edit Task with recurring 
Edit a task to include a recurring with the following command `edit <index> rec/d` or `edit <index> rec/w`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more. 

For example: `edit 1 rec/d` as shown below.

.Input for editing recurring attribute to task.
image::recurring_edit.png[width=395]

Results in a task with the reminder's date in the specific task card.
