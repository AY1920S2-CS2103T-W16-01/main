=== Indexes
[IMPORTANT]
====
Indexes refer to the current tasklist on display, it does not refer to the indices of the entire task list. Note also that indexes start from 1 and not 0.
====

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `bb_productive.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your BB Productive.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
_This section provides a quick description for the common terminologies used in this user guide._

*Task*: A task is something that you need to complete. It is represented as a card on the right side of the window. Set reminders, add tags and more to better manage your tasks!

*Pomodoro*: A productivity technique that consists of doing focused work for 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. This technique prevents you from tiring out while doing work.

*Pet*: The pet you will interact with to manage your tasks and pomodoros. You can also level up the pet by completing more tasks/pomodoros.

==== Edit Command
`edit n/Look edited the task des/BB Productive is the best app I've every used t/NewTag` +

==== Sort Command
`sort FIELD FIELD...`
You can choose to change the current ordering of your task list to something more suitable by sorting it one or more of these task fields:

_All fields with r- prepended refers to a reverse of the original._

. priority -> Shows task of highest priority first.
. r-priority -> Shows task of lowest priority first.
. done -> Shows task of undone first.
. r-done -> Shows task of done first.
. date -> Shows tasks with reminders closer to today first then tasks without reminders.
. r-date -> Shows tasks with no remidners first then tasks with reminders further from today.
. name -> Shows tasks in alphanumeric order.
. r-name -> Shows tasks in reverse alphanumeric order.

.Sort success

==== Find Command
`find PHRASE`
You can perform a search for tasks by name that are important. BB Productive will then search through the names of the tasks and bring tasks that match the `PHRASE`. It is also typo tolerant and will show tasks that differ from the `PHRASE` by a little.

.Find success

[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
_This section describes the Pomodoro feature in detail and contains all commands you can use to take advantage of it_

==== What's Pomodoro?
In the late 1980s, a gentleman named Francesco Cirillo devised a time management method called the Pomodoro Technique. Essentially, a single cycle consists of two parts, 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minutes break. This cycle repeats for as long as you want to get work done.

==== How do you use it?
Trying to prevent burnout? BB productive offers you the option to try out the pomodoro tenchinique! The pomodoro technique breaks down work into manageable intervals spaced out with short breaks so as to not tired you out._

To get started, follow the instructions below:

===== Command: `pom`

First, you can activate the Pomodoro timer with a task in focus. You can also add an optional timer amount field, different from the default time of 25 minutes, for that particular cycle.

Format: `pom <index> [tm/<amount in minutes>]`

You can use the value (decimals allowed) following `tm/` to represent your desired amount of time in minutes for a particular pomodoro cycle.

.Example screen when pom is successfully executed.
image::pom_success.png[width=790]

===== Command: `pom pause`

You can pause a running Pomodoro timer.

.Example screen when pom is successfully paused
image::pom_pause.png[width=790]

===== Command: `pom continue`

You can resume a paused Pomodoro timer.

.Example screen when pom is successfully resumed
image::pom_continuing.png[width=790]


==== What happens when the timer's up?

===== "Done" the task
Once the timer expires, the app will prompt you if you have finished the task. You need only respond with Yes (Y) or No (N) in order to proceed.

.Prompt when the pomodoro timer expires
image::pom_time_expire.png[width=790]

===== Break-time
Afterwards, the app will prompt you if you would like to begin a 5 minute break (as per the pomodoro technique). Similarly, you need to respond with Yes (Y) or No (N). Responding with No will set the app to its neutral state. Yes will start the break timer.

.Prompt checking if you'd like to take a break
image::pom_prompt_break.png[width=790]

Note: You will not be able to do execute other commands during these prompts.

===== Back to work
At the end of the break, the app will return to it's "neutral" state and you can  repeat the process, if you wish.

=== Statistics (Permas)

Views statistics generated through the app usage.
stats SPEED/DONE
SPEED : Displays average time taken to complete tasks over past week/month/year.
DONE : Displays average number of tasks done over past week/month/year.

=== AutoComplete
As much as you enjoy typing, we've added some extra grease to make you type even faster. You can trigger our very intelligent auto complete function by pressing `tab` on the keyboard.

You can expect: +

* Auto completion of command words: `del -> delete`
* Addition of prefixes for common values: `20/10/20@10:30 -> r/20/10/20@10:30`
** Figure 14
* Auto completion of sort fields `sort pri` -> `sort priority`
** Figure 15

.Prefix auto complete

.Sort auto complete

If we can't find a valid command, you will observe feedback like below:

.Auto complete not found

=== Reminders (Arthur)
