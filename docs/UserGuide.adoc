[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
_This section provides a quick description for the common terminologies used in this user guide._

*Task*: A task is something that you need to complete. It is represented as a card on the right side of the window. Set reminders, add tags and more to better manage your tasks!

*Pomodoro*: A productivity technique that consists of doing focused work for 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. This technique prevents you from tiring out while doing work.

*Pet*: The pet you will interact with to manage your tasks and pomodoros. You can also level up the pet by completing more tasks/pomodoros.

== Graphical User Interface (Permas)
This section gives you a brief overview of the various GUI components present in BB Productive.

=== Pet View
The Pet View is where you can view your pet, its name, level and experience gained. With diligent usage of BB Productive, its experience (XP) and level will increase with time.

// tag::pomodoro[]
[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
_In this section, let's learn how you can take advantage of the Pomodoro feature to boost your productivity! Learn all the commands you can use for Pomodoro._

==== What's Pomodoro?
In the late 1980s, a gentleman named Francesco Cirillo devised a time management method called the Pomodoro Technique. Essentially, a single cycle consists of two parts, 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minutes break. This cycle repeats for as long as you want to get work done.

==== Let's get started!
BBProductive's Pomodoro feature is very easy to use. Let's take a look at the following steps!

===== Step 1: `pom` a task to get started!

You can activate the Pomodoro timer and set a task you want to focus on. The default timer for a work cycle is 25 minutes. However, you can add an optional timer amount field for a particular cycle.

Format: `pom <index> [tm/<amount in minutes>]`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Indexes refer to the current tasklist on display, it does not refer to the indices of the entire task list. Note also that indexes start from 1 and not 0.

You can use the value (decimals allowed) following `tm/` to represent your desired amount of time in *minutes* for a particular pomodoro cycle.
====

After you've successfully _pommed_ a task, you can see the task's name in the bar at the top of the tasklist. The timer there will start counting down as well.

.Example screen when pom is successfully executed
image::pom_success.png[width=790]

===== Step 2: `pom pause` if you need to take a quick break.

Not exactly a break. But let's say you need to leave your desk real quick. You can pause a running Pomodoro timer by simply calling `pom pause`.

Once, you've paused pomodoro, the timer will freeze and remain so until you resume in the next step.

.Example screen when pom is successfully paused
image::pom_pause.png[width=790]

===== Step 3: `pom continue` to get back to work.

Now that you're back and ready to get back to work, simply use `pom continue` to resume for where you left off.

.Example screen when pom is successfully resumed
image::pom_continuing.png[width=790]

===== Step 4: Time's up!

Once the timer expires, the app will prompt you if you have finished the task. You need only respond with Yes (Y) or No (N) in order to proceed.

.Prompt when the pomodoro timer expires
image::pom_time_expire.png[width=790]

===== Step 5: Break-time!
Afterwards, the app will prompt you if you would like to begin a 5 minute break (as per the pomodoro technique). Similarly, you need to respond with Yes (Y) or No (N). Responding with No will set the app to its neutral state. Yes will start the break timer.

.Prompt checking if you'd like to take a break
image::pom_prompt_break.png[width=790]

[IMPORTANT]
=====
You will not be able to do execute other commands during these prompts. Please respond to the prompts to proceed.
=====

===== Back to Step 1?
At the end of the break, the app will return to it's "neutral" state and you can  repeat the process, if you wish.

.End of pomodoro cycle screen
image::pom_break_end.png[width=790]

// end::pomodoro[]

=== Statistics (Permas)
As you continue to use BB Productive, you may start to wonder how productive you have been over time. This is where our Statistics feature comes in! Simply type in the command 'stats' to access the Statistics Tab and track your productivity. Look out for the background color of the Statistics Tab. If it turns orange after you type the command this means you are on the correct tab.

The Statistics Tab consists of 2 features to help you keep track of your productivity.

.Statistics Tab
image::stats_tab.png[width=400]

==== Daily Challenge
The Daily Challenge is a progress bar that tracks the total duration you have kept the Pomodoro running on the current day. The more you run the Pomodoro, the more the progress bar fills, and the closer you are to clearing the challenge! Try to clear the Daily Challenge everyday to hit your productivity goals!

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can customise the duration you aim to achieve on a daily basis by using the Set Command as introduced in section 6.x //TODO link.
====

==== Productivity Chart
The Productivity Chart tracks the number of tasks done and duration you ran the Pomodoro per day for the past 7 days. You can thus track your productivity over time. With this information. you can make proper adjustments to your schedule to improve your productivity. If you start noticing the orange bars getting shorter, realise that it is time to buckle up and work harder, or else you may lose your productivity momentum!

=== AutoComplete
As much as you enjoy typing, we've added some extra grease to make you type even faster. You can trigger our very intelligent auto complete function by pressing `tab` on the keyboard.

You can expect: +

* Auto completion of command words: `del -> delete`
* Addition of prefixes for common values: `20/10/20@10:30 -> r/20/10/20@10:30`
** Figure 14
* Auto completion of sort fields `sort pri` -> `sort priority`
** Figure 15

.Prefix auto complete

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminders

==== What's a reminder?
BBProductive provides an avenue to remember to do time sensitive tasks in the form of reminders. When the time for the reminder has arrived, BBProductive alerts you to do the task! Never forget to do buy milk or any other time sensitive task ever again!

==== How do you use it?
Add a reminder to your task by adding `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` when editing or adding a task. A pop up containing the task name and description will then appear reminding you to complete the task at the specified date and time.

==== Command `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`
===== Add Task with reminder
Add task with reminder with the following command `add n/<name> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `add n/Buy Milk r/11/11/20@23:59` as shown below.

.Input for adding a task with reminder.
image::reminder_add.png[width=395]

This results in a task with the reminder's date in the task card.

.Success for adding a task with reminder.
image::reminder_add_success.png[width=790]

[IMPORTANT]
====
- Firstly, the format for the date must adhere strictly to the `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` format or else it will not be recognized. 
- Secondly, the date can only be set in the future and not the past. +
An error message will be shown on the result display if either of the 2 aforementioned issues are breached. This applies for editing as task to have a reminder as well.
====

===== Edit Task with reminder
Edit a task to include a reminder with the following command `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `edit 1 r/01/11/20@11:59` as shown below.

.Input for editing task to have reminder or edit reminder itself.
image::reminder_edit.png[width=395]

Results in a task with the reminder's date in the task card.

.Success for editing task's reminder.
image::reminder_edit_success.png[width=790]

// end::reminder[]

// tag::recurring[]
=== Recurring

==== What's Recurring?
Recurring tasks allows you to have repeated tasks either every day or every week. This means the task previously set as done will be set as unfinished. Furthermore, if there is a reminder set, recurring tasks is smart enough to change the reminder date according to the interval you set. This means a reminder that has already been triggered for a daily recurring task will also fire again the following day.

==== How do you use it?
Add a recurring attribute to your task by adding `rec/d` for daily recurring tasks or `rec/w` for weekly. This will trigger the recurring behaviour for the task including the task's done and reminder attribute.

===== Command `rec/d` or `rec/w`
===== Add Task with recurring
Add task with recurring with the following command `add n/<name> rec/d` or `add n/<name> rec/w`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `add n/Buy Milk rec/d` as shown below.

.Input for adding recurring attribute to task.
image::recurring_add.png[width=395]

Results in a task with the recurring attribute in the task card as well as result display giving feedback.

.Success for adding recurring attribute shown on result display.
image::recurring_add_success_resultDisplay.png[width=396]

.Success for adding recurring attribute to task card.
image::recurring_add_success.png[width=790]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The format for recurring is strictly `rec/d` or `rec/w` as there is only daily and weekly recurring tasks. Any other input will be recognized as invalid and an error message will be shown on the result display.
====

===== Edit Task with recurring
Edit a task to include a recurring with the following command `edit <index> rec/d` or `edit <index> rec/w`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `edit 1 rec/d` as shown below.

.Input for editing recurring attribute to task.
image::recurring_edit.png[width=395]

Results in a task with the reminder's date in the specific task card.

.Success for editing recurring attribute to task.
image::recurring_edit_success.png[width=790]

=== Recurring behaviour when task is marked as done
Mark a task as done as you would normally using the command `done <index>`. For a recurring task, after the stipulated amount of time(either daily or weekly), the task will be reset as undone. 

For example: `done 1`. After a day's worth of time, the task will be set from done to undone.

.Task has been reset shown on result display.
image::recurring_behaviour_undone_resultDisplay.png[width=395]

.Task has been reset shown on task card.
image::recurring_behaviour_undone.png[width=790]

=== Recurring behaviour when task has reminder
Add a reminder as you would normally using the command `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` or `add n/<name> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm rec/<type>` if you are adding the task. For a recurring task, after the stipulated amount of time(either daily or weekly), the reminder will increment by the time interval if it has been triggered. This means the reminder will be incremented by 1 day if the time interval is daily, and 7 days if the time interval is weekly.

For example: `done 1`. After a day's worth of time, the task will be set from done to undone.

.Task initially has a reminder for 13th April 2020 at 12:41PM.
